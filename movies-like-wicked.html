From reimagined fairy tales to fantastical musicals, these films capture the spirit of Wicked's untold stories, complex friendships, and exploration of good versus evil.</p>

      <h2>Wicked (2024) - Quick Overview</h2>
      <div class="wicked-meta">

        <span class="genre">Musical</span> <span class="genre">Fantasy</span> <span class="genre">Fairy Tale</span>
        <p>Stephen Sondheim's masterpiece intertwines classic fairy tales in this dark musical fantasy. Like Wicked, it subverts traditional stories - Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, and others discover the consequences of their wishes in the second act. Meryl Streep's Witch delivers a show-stopping performance similar to Elphaba's, particularly in her powerful solo "Stay With Me." The film explores how good intentions can lead to complicated outcomes, much like Wicked's moral complexity.</p>
        <div class="why-watch">

        <span class="genre">Musical</span> <span class="genre">Fantasy</span> <span class="genre">Classic</span>
        <p>The film that inspired Wicked remains essential viewing. Judy Garland's Dorothy travels from black-and-white Kansas to Technicolor Oz, encountering characters that Wicked later recontextualizes. Watching the original provides fascinating contrast to see how Wicked reimagines the Wicked Witch's motivations and Glinda's character. The songs ("Over the Rainbow," "Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead") are just as iconic as Wicked's musical numbers, and the practical effects remain impressive decades later.</p>
        <div class="why-watch">

        <span class="genre">Musical</span> <span class="genre">Fantasy</span> <span class="genre">Urban</span>
        <p>This African-American reinterpretation of The Wizard of Oz features Diana Ross as Dorothy and Michael Jackson as the Scarecrow. Like Wicked, it offers a fresh cultural perspective on the Oz story, with spectacular musical numbers including "Ease on Down the Road" and "Brand New Day." The urban fantasy setting provides a unique visual style that influenced later musicals, and its themes of self-discovery parallel Elphaba's journey in Wicked.</p>

        <p>Anne Hathaway stars in this clever Cinderella retelling where the heroine is cursed with obedience. Like Elphaba in Wicked, Ella must overcome societal expectations and a literal curse to claim her independence. The film blends humor and heart with its fairy tale setting, featuring musical numbers that showcase Hathaway's Broadway-honed vocals. Its themes of resisting unjust systems resonate with Wicked's rebellious spirit.</p>
        <div class="why-watch">

        <p>Sam Raimi's visually stunning prequel explores how Oscar Diggs became the Wizard of Oz, featuring Mila Kunis as Theodora's transformation into the Wicked Witch. While not a musical, it shares Wicked's interest in the witches' backstories and the Wizard's manipulative nature. The film's CGI creates an Oz that bridges the 1939 film's aesthetic with modern technology, much like Wicked's cinematic interpretation of the stage musical's world.</p>
        <div class="why-watch">
