    <h1>5 Action-Packed Movies Like Thunderbolts (2025)</h1>
    
    <p class="intro">If you're excited for Thunderbolts' team of complex antiheroes and morally gray missions, you'll love these similar films featuring unconventional teams, high-stakes action, and surprising heart. From DC's Task Force X to Marvel's cosmic misfits, these movies deliver the same blend of humor and heroism that makes Thunderbolts so anticipated.</p>

    <div class="movie">

      <div class="movie-content">
        <h2><a href="https://www.wheretowatch.stream/movies/436969/the-suicide-squad/in/ca">The Suicide Squad (2021)</a></h2>
        <span class="genre-tag">Superhero Action-Comedy</span>
        <p class="streaming-info">Available on HBO Max, Apple TV</p>
        <p>James Gunn's <strong>The Suicide Squad</strong> perfectly captures Thunderbolts' premise with imprisoned supervillains sent on deadly government missions. Like Thunderbolts, it balances outrageous action with unexpected character depth, particularly in Bloodsport's reluctant leadership (similar to Bucky Barnes') and Peacemaker's moral ambiguity (echoing Ghost's complexity). The film's mix of stylized violence and genuine pathos makes it the closest counterpart to Thunderbolts' promised tone.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.wheretowatch.stream/movies/34813/the-losers/in/gb">The Losers (2010)</a></h2>
        <span class="genre-tag">Action Thriller</span>
        <p class="streaming-info">Available on Amazon Prime, Hulu</p>
        <p>This underrated gem follows <strong>The Losers</strong>, a black ops team left for dead who seek revenge. Its blend of military action and dark humor previews Thunderbolts' likely dynamic, especially in the team's reluctant cooperation and specialized skillsets. Chris Evans' wisecracking Jensen offers a prototype for MCU's humor, while the team's mission against a powerful organization mirrors Thunderbolts' likely conflicts with shadowy forces.</p>

    <div class="movie">

        <h2><a href="https://www.wheretowatch.stream/movies/383498/deadpool-2/in/nz">Deadpool 2 (2018)</a></h2>
        <span class="genre-tag">Superhero Comedy</span>
        <p class="streaming-info">Available on Disney+, Hulu</p>
        <p><strong>Deadpool 2's</strong> X-Force sequence directly inspired Thunderbolts' team concept, particularly in its subversion of superhero tropes. The film's balance of irreverent humor and genuine stakes (especially in Cable's storyline) suggests how Thunderbolts might handle its darker themes. Domino's luck-based powers demonstrate how Thunderbolts could showcase unique abilities, while the film's meta-commentary predicts possible self-awareness in Thunderbolts' approach to Marvel lore.</p>

        <span class="genre-tag">Space Adventure</span>
        <p class="streaming-info">Available on Disney+</p>
        <p>James Gunn's <strong>Guardians of the Galaxy</strong> provides the blueprint for Thunderbolts' likely character dynamics. The film's "found family" among misfits (a thief, assassin, warrior, and genetically enhanced creatures) mirrors how Thunderbolts might unite its disparate members. Star-Lord's leadership struggles preview Bucky Barnes' potential arc, while Gamora and Nebula's rivalry-turned-alliance suggests how Thunderbolts could develop complex relationships among former enemies.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://www.wheretowatch.stream/movies/495764/birds-of-prey-and-the-fantabulous-emancipation-of-one-harley-quinn/in/in">Birds of Prey (2020)</a></h2>
        <span class="genre-tag">Superhero Action</span>
        <p class="streaming-info">Available on HBO Max, Apple TV</p>
        <p><strong>Birds of Prey</strong> demonstrates how Thunderbolts might balance individual backstories with team dynamics. Harley Quinn's chaotic energy resembles Ghost's potential unpredictability, while Huntress' tragic past parallels Bucky's Winter Soldier history. The film's vibrant action sequences (especially the police station fight) suggest how Thunderbolts could showcase each member's unique fighting style. Its R-rated humor and violence also hint at Thunderbolts' possible tone.</p>
