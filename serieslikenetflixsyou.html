    <h1>10 Gripping Shows Like Netflix's You </h1>
    
    <p class="intro">If you're fascinated by You's blend of psychological thriller, dark romance, and unreliable narration, these series deliver similarly addictive stories about obsession, dangerous relationships, and the masks people wear. From serial killers to manipulative lovers, these shows explore the dark side of human connection that makes You so compelling.</p>

    <div class="show">
      <img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/q8dWfc4JwQuv3HayIZeO84jAXED.jpg" alt="Dexter poster" loading="lazy">

        <h2><a href="https://www.wheretowatch.stream/shows/1405/dexter/in/ca">Dexter</a></h2>
        <span class="platform-tag showtime">Showtime</span>
        <p class="streaming-info">Available on Showtime, Paramount+</p>
        <p><strong>Dexter</strong> follows a blood spatter analyst with a secret life as a vigilante serial killer. Like Joe Goldberg in You, Dexter Morgan narrates his dark thoughts while maintaining a normal facade. The show's exploration of a killer's psychology and moral code makes it the closest counterpart to You's disturbing charm. Michael C. Hall's performance balances menace and relatability much like Penn Badgley's portrayal of Joe.</p>
      </div>

        <h2><a href="https://www.wheretowatch.stream/shows/46786/bates-motel/in/au">Bates Motel</a></h2>
        <span class="platform-tag peacock">Peacock</span>
        <p class="streaming-info">Available on Peacock</p>
        <p>This <strong>Psycho</strong> prequel explores Norman Bates' twisted relationship with his mother. Like You, it features a sympathetic yet terrifying protagonist whose mental state deteriorates over time. Freddie Highmore's portrayal of Norman mirrors Joe Goldberg's descent, with both characters justifying increasingly horrific actions. The show's exploration of mother-son codependency offers similarly uncomfortable fascination as You's toxic relationships.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="show">
      <img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/fm7nN3nUADA7JGgnFNlOWpXn1tf.jpg" alt="The Fall poster" loading="lazy">
      <div class="show-content">
        <h2><a href="https://www.wheretowatch.stream/shows/49010/the-fall/in/gb">The Fall</a></h2>
        <span class="platform-tag amazon">Amazon Prime</span>
        <p class="streaming-info">Available on Amazon Prime</p>
        <p>Gillian Anderson stars as a detective hunting Jamie Dornan's serial killer in this cat-and-mouse thriller. <strong>The Fall</strong> shares You's dual perspective structure, alternating between hunter and hunted. Paul Spector's family-man facade and secret life parallel Joe Goldberg's deceptions. The show's slow-burn tension and psychological depth make it essential for You fans who enjoy complex character studies of predators.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="show">
      <img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/fbKE87mojpIETWepSbD5Qt741fp.jpg" alt="Mindhunter poster" loading="lazy">
      <div class="show-content">
        <h2><a href="https://www.wheretowatch.stream/shows/67744/mindhunter/in/nz">Mindhunter</a></h2>
        <span class="platform-tag netflix">Netflix</span>
        <p class="streaming-info">Available on Netflix</p>
        <p>David Fincher's <strong>Mindhunter</strong> delves into the psychology of serial killers through FBI interviews. While more procedural than You, it shares the fascination with what makes predators tick. The show's unsettling atmosphere and focus on manipulation tactics (similar to Joe's gaslighting) make it compelling for fans of psychological depth. Its historical basis adds chilling realism to the study of criminal minds.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="show">

        <h2><a href="https://www.wheretowatch.stream/shows/97173/behind-her-eyes/in/ie">Behind Her Eyes</a></h2>
        <span class="platform-tag netflix">Netflix</span>
        <p class="streaming-info">Available on Netflix</p>
        <p>This twisty thriller follows a single mother who becomes entangled with a married couple. <strong>Behind Her Eyes</strong> shares You's themes of obsession and dangerous secrets, with a similarly unreliable narrative perspective. The limited series format allows for a tightly plotted story with shocking reveals that rival You's biggest twists. Its exploration of psychological manipulation makes it perfect for fans of mind games.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

        <span class="platform-tag hulu">Hulu</span>
        <p class="streaming-info">Available on Hulu</p>
        <p>Steve Carell plays a therapist held captive by his serial killer patient. <strong>The Patient</strong> explores the dynamic between a manipulator and their target, similar to You's power struggles. The confined setting creates intense psychological drama, focusing on how people rationalize evil. Like Joe Goldberg, the killer here believes he can change, creating disturbing sympathy for a monster.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="show">

        <span class="platform-tag netflix">Netflix</span>
        <p class="streaming-info">Available on Netflix</p>
        <p>Based on true events, <strong>Dirty John</strong> follows a charismatic con artist who infiltrates a wealthy family. The show shares You's themes of deception in relationships and the danger of charming outsiders. Eric Bana's John Meehan is a real-world counterpart to Joe Goldberg, using manipulation rather than violence to control his victims. The true crime basis adds chilling realism to the story.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="show">

        <span class="platform-tag hulu">Hulu</span>
        <p class="streaming-info">Available on Hulu</p>
        <p>While lighter in tone, <strong>Younger</strong> explores identity deception like You, with a 40-year-old woman pretending to be in her 20s. The show's examination of how lies compound and the masks people wear makes it an interesting thematic companion. Sutton Foster's Liza navigates romantic entanglements while maintaining her facade, similar to Joe's balancing act, though with more comedy than horror.</p>

        <p class="streaming-info">Available on HBO Max</p>
        <p>Amy Adams stars as a troubled journalist investigating murders in her hometown. <strong>Sharp Objects</strong> shares You's themes of psychological trauma and unreliable narration. The limited series format allows for deep character study, with Camille's self-destructive tendencies mirroring Joe's. Its Southern Gothic atmosphere creates a similarly oppressive mood, where past sins haunt the present.</p>

        <p class="streaming-info">Available on AMC+, Hulu</p>
        <p>This cat-and-mouse thriller follows an intelligence agent and the assassin obsessed with her. <strong>Killing Eve</strong> shares You's themes of dangerous obsession and blurred lines between hunter and prey. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer's electric performances create a twisted dynamic similar to Joe's relationships. The show's dark humor and stylish violence make it perfect for You fans who enjoy charismatic killers.</p>

      <h2>Key Themes in These Psychological Thrillers</h2>
      
      <div class="theme-item">
        <h3>Obsessive Relationships</h3>
        <p>Like You, these shows explore dangerous fixations - from Dexter's need to kill to Villanelle's obsession with Eve in Killing Eve. They examine how obsession corrupts both the hunter and the hunted.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="theme-item">
        <h3>Unreliable Narrators</h3>
        <p>Many feature protagonists who lie to themselves and viewers, similar to Joe Goldberg's self-justifications. Norman Bates in Bates Motel and Camille in Sharp Objects present distorted versions of reality.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="theme-item">
        <h3>Dual Identities</h3>
        <p>Characters lead double lives - Dexter the killer/forensic expert, Liza the older woman/young professional in Younger. Like Joe, they maintain facades while hiding darker selves.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="theme-item">
        <h3>Psychological Manipulation</h3>
        <p>Gaslighting, mind games, and emotional abuse feature prominently, especially in The Fall, Behind Her Eyes, and Dirty John. These shows reveal how predators exploit vulnerabilities.</p>
