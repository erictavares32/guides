      <h2>Key Themes in These Post-Apocalyptic Shows</h2>
      
      <div class="theme-item">
        <h3>Survival & Sacrifice</h3>
        <p>Like The Last of Us, these shows explore what people will do to survive and protect loved ones. From The Walking Dead's brutal choices to Station Eleven's artistic resilience, each examines survival's physical and emotional costs.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="theme-item">
        <h3>Found Family</h3>
        <p>With biological families often lost, characters form new bonds. Sweet Tooth's Gus and Tommy, The Last of Us' Joel and Ellie, and The 100's delinquents all demonstrate how connection persists even in collapse.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="theme-item">
        <h3>Moral Complexity</h3>
        <p>These shows avoid simple heroes and villains. Like Joel's controversial actions, characters in The Leftovers, Snowpiercer, and Black Summer make impossible choices that challenge viewers' sympathies.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="theme-item">
        <h3>World-Building</h3>
        <p>From Station Eleven's traveling theater to Snowpiercer's class-divided train, these shows create fully realized post-apocalyptic societies with their own rules, cultures, and threats, much like The Last of Us' various survivor factions.</p>
