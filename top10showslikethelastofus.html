        <p class="streaming-info">Available on HBO Max, Apple TV</p>
        <p>A haunting dramatization of the 1986 nuclear disaster, <strong>Chernobyl</strong> explores the chilling consequences of bureaucratic negligence and heroism amidst chaos. Like The Last of Us, it showcases ordinary people facing extraordinary catastrophes, with visceral storytelling that captures psychological horror and the tragic fallout of disaster.</p>

        <p class="streaming-info">Available on Netflix, AMC+</p>
        <p>The iconic zombie series that defined survival horror television. <strong>The Walking Dead</strong> explores ever-evolving threats (both undead and human) with gripping stories about loss, leadership, and maintaining humanity in a lawless world. Its early seasons particularly mirror The Last of Us' themes of found family and moral dilemmas in crisis.</p>
