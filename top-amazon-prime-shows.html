      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Amazon Prime Shows</h2>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What are the newest Amazon Prime Video shows in 2025?</h3>
        <p>The most recent standout additions to Amazon Prime Video in early 2025 include <strong>Fallout</strong> (March 2025), the second season of <strong>The Boys: Gen V</strong> (February 2025), and <strong>Étoile</strong> (January 2025). These join established hits like The Wheel of Time and Reacher, which released new seasons in late 2024.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does the Fallout TV series connect to the games?</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Fallout</strong> TV series exists within the same canon as the video games but tells an original story. It features new characters and locations while including familiar elements like Vault-Tec, Power Armor, the Brotherhood of Steel, and the retro-futuristic 1950s aesthetic. The show carefully maintains the games' tone, blending dark humor with serious post-apocalyptic drama.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I watch The Boys: Gen V without seeing The Boys?</h3>
        <p>While <strong>The Boys: Gen V</strong> works as a standalone series, we recommend watching <strong>The Boys</strong> first for full context. The spinoff assumes familiarity with the world's rules, corporations like Vought International, and the societal impact of superheroes. Some characters from The Boys appear in Gen V, and events from the main series affect the spinoff's storyline.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is The Wheel of Time suitable for Game of Thrones fans?</h3>
        <p><strong>The Wheel of Time</strong> offers a different but equally compelling fantasy experience for <strong>Game of Thrones</strong> fans. While it features less political intrigue and graphic content, it delivers epic world-building, complex magic systems, and large-scale battles. The focus on prophecy, reincarnation, and the battle between light and dark provides a fresh take on fantasy storytelling that many Thrones fans enjoy.</p>
